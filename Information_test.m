% This is a test to see if the set up of the new github repository has
% worked. This github will serve as the main overview of all coding files,
% separated by assignments in the sub-folders.

% The whole documentation and creation of the report is being done with
% Overleaf, where Latex can be used very easily. A template has already
% been created and been made accessible.
